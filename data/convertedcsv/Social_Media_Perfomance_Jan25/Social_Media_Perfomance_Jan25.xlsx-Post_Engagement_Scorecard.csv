Heightened security measures will continue at all entry gates, including 100% ID checks and random inspections, however, the command is taking steps to mitigate the impacts of these protocols on our service members and their families. 

For this weekend, during hours when the Camp Pendleton Visitor Center is closed, PMO may grant escort status to individuals who meet the requirements for DBIDS access. Please note that individuals requesting this access over the weekend will need to bring at least ONE of the following documents:

- Valid (unexpired) drivers license 
- State Identification Card 
- U.S. Passport  

If individuals requesting this access pass do not have any of the credentials listed above, they must present ALL THREE of the documents below as an alternative. 

- Original or Certified Birth Certificate (Raised Seal) 
- Social Security Card
- Driver’s License

Individuals who meet the requirements for base access this weekend WILL BE REQUIRED to formally register at the Visitor Center on Monday. PMO will be documenting everyone’s information and if individuals who gain access this weekend do not register at the Visitor Center on Monday, future base access may be restricted. 

Additionally, base patrons are HIGHLY encouraged to pre-register individuals they intend to sponsor on Camp Pendleton. This will significantly increase the flow of traffic at the Visitors Center throughout next week. 

For information on how to pre-register, visit the link below ⬇️ and look at BASE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS: UNESCORTED U.S. CITIZEN REQUEST

The Trusted Traveler Program was a procedure that allowed DoD-affiliated sponsors to vouch for vehicle occupants to gain entry onto an installation. All unvetted visitors must report to the installation Visitor Center to request access. 

For further details on MCRD Parris Island access procedures please visit: https://www.mcrdpi.marines.mil/Visitors/Base-Access/

2025-01-22,"It’s with a heavy heart that we share the passing of comic artist Arthur Nichols at the age of 63 after a long battle with cancer. Arthur’s career spanned decades, and he made lasting contributions to the comic world, working on iconic series like Star Wars, Punisher, X-Men, Night Thrasher, Conan, and Justice League of America. He co-created the Eisner-nominated The American and the character Rose Wilson, daughter of Deathstroke. He also helped shape the look of Astro City and worked on major projects like Magnus Robot Fighter with Bob Layton at Valiant Comics.

Beyond comics, Arthur’s talents extended to commercial design, creating everything from DC Comics kids' meal toys to Star Wars cup toppers. He also worked as a storyboard artist on the Oscar-winning The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, as well as Ultimate Spider-Man, GI Joe, and Scooby-Doo.

Arthur’s legacy is one of creativity and passion, and he will be deeply missed by fans and colleagues alike. RIP, Arthur.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Check out these fan favorites from 2024 (all available for checkout through the Camp Pendleton Libraries!) and find your next page-turner:

👰 The Wedding People by Alison Espach
""The year’s surprise sensation, Alison Espach’s improbably fun novel follows the adventures of a severely bummed out young woman who finds herself accidentally crashing a lavish wedding at a posh Rhode Island inn. Readers love Espach’s twisty tonal shifts—from high drama to screwball comedy of manners—and the ultimate moral of her story: Go with the flow; who knows what might happen?"" - Goodreads

🎖 The Women by Kristin Hannah
""An insightful meditation on courage, character, and women gone to war, Kristin Hannah’s novel introduces idealistic Army nurse Frances “Frankie” McGrath as she volunteers in Vietnam, circa 1965. Incredibly, her life gets even more complicated when she returns to a dangerously divided America."" - Goodreads

🌲 The God of the Woods by Liz Moore
""In 1975, troubled teenager Barbara Van Laar vanished from her bunk at the summer camp owned by her wealthy family. Making things so much worse: Her older brother disappeared much the same way, 16 years ago. Author Liz Moore expands this intriguing premise into an emotionally engaging mystery that blends elements of crime fiction, psychological suspense, and complex family drama."" - Goodreads

😂 Funny Story by Emily Henry
""Romance queen Emily Henry takes home her fourth consecutive GCA with Funny Story, an instructive modern parable about a heartbroken librarian who attempts an extremely tricky maneuver: hooking up with her ex-fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex. (Very dangerous—don’t try this at home.) Hollywood trade reports suggest that Henry will be writing her own screenplay for the upcoming film adaptation."" - Goodreads

🔥 House of Flame and Shadow by Sarah J. Maas
In this epic fantasy, a young woman with incredible powers must navigate a world of politics, betrayal, and war. As her loyalty is tested and enemies close in, she must face the shadow of her past and embrace the strength within. In the 3rd installment of her Crescent City series, Maas crafts an enthralling tale of magic, passion, and danger. 

⏳ The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley
A captivating, mind-bending exploration of time travel and its consequences, where a secret ministry protects history from interference. The protagonist discovers the complexities of altering the past, and the personal cost of such power. Bradley’s narrative delivers suspense and thought-provoking questions about fate and free will.

🖤 You Like It Darker by Stephen King
""Maine’s resident gentleman maniac returns with a short story collection on the abiding terrors of the human condition—fate and mortality, tragedy and violence. Also: rattlesnakes. King is the king of the horror novel, of course, but he’s a master of short fiction, too, and many are calling this collection his finest yet."" - Goodreads

🌊 Somewhere Beyond the Sea by T.J. Klune
""In the sequel to 2020’s much-admired The House in the Cerulean Sea, author T.J. Klune returns to the mysterious orphanage on Marsyas Island and its menagerie of magical children and creatures. Klune’s themes of unconditional love and found family have attracted a loyal readership."" - Goodreads",5,5,0,0,293,0
